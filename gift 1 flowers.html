        <p class="tw">
          Do you remember the first time we gave each other flowers? It was the beginning of summer, and you picked a wild flower for me on your way to the class. You said that meant you might kill for me.
        </p>
        <p class="tw">
          I don't clearly remember if i first gave you a flower that was plucked myself, but I do remember getting the tulips from the shop across the store you were working in. I think I decided on tulips to make it less cliché than perhaps, roses.
        </p>
        <p class="tw">
          Over the time, we've had adorned each other with many flowers, some from stores, some from backyards, and some wild ones we picked ourselves. All of them got to be part of something bigger than themselves, I'd like to think. 
        </p>
        <p class="tw">
          Do you remember when the summer came and we hated the heat? But everytime we went out walking under the sun there was one thing that made us forget the heat. Little dandelions.
        </p>
        <p class="tw">
          We'll be stopping to gather them in our palms and float them over the path we're walking. Do you think they tell other plants and little insects the stories of us wherever they land?
          </p>
        <p class="tw">
          Then winter came, and with it, shy flowers and brown leaves. No flowers to be seen anytime we step out but that didn't stop us. We found a way to keep each other's room fragnant with floral scents. We even tried preserving flowers to keep the memory alive, even when the flowers said their goodbyes.
          </p>
        <p class="tw">
          And now each flower carries a memory, a moment of joy, a vibrant "I saw this and I thought about you". What more could one ask for?
